## Get Started

You can either `cd` into each directory and run the separate stacks as individual applications, or use the included `docker-compose.yml` file to spin everything up under Docker containers.

TODO: add some previous step

```sh
# these init steps can do with -exec docker mode
cd src/frontend/src && npm install
cd src/backend/src && composer install

# main deploy
docker compose up
```
